XRD Playground
This software calculates the Powder X-Ray Diffraction (pXRD) of a simple structure defined by the user. By using sliders to control the lattice parameters and angles between axes, the diffraction pattern changes instantly, so the user can see the effect of each parameter into the pattern. It has also the possibility to include up to 10 atoms in the unit cell, controlling their type and position. It is a nice program to use for teaching pXRD! Feel fre to use it, and we are pleased if you cite it (we are going to publish soon!!) :D
